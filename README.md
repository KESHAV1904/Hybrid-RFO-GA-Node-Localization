Because it is expensive and energy-intensive to equip every node with GPS, node localization is a major difficulty in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). 
Network operations including routing, monitoring, and data aggregation are improved by effective localization.
The convergence speed and localization accuracy of conventional methods and fundamental metaheuristic methodologies, such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA), are limited. 
To overcome these limitations, this thesis suggests a hybrid approach that combines Genetic approach (GA) with Red Fox Optimization (RFO).
While GA guarantees efficient exploitation through crossover and mutation operations, RFO emulates the clever hunting behavior of red foxes, permitting greater exploration of the solution space. 
The hybrid strategy improves the harmony between local refinement and worldwide search. 
MATLAB is used to implement the suggested RFO-GA algorithm, which is then tested in simulated WSN scenarios with different anchor node distributions and node densities. 
Robustness, convergence speed, and localization error are used to assess performance. 
RFO-GA exhibits better accuracy and faster convergence when compared to PSO, solo GA, and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithms. 
The outcomes confirm that the hybrid approach is a successful and efficient substitute for node localization in WSNs. 
This study opens up possibilities for future real-time applications and offers fresh perspectives on metaheuristic hybridization.
